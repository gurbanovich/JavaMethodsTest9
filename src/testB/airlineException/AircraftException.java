	 * Represents an invocation context for a service operation. A
	 * ServiceContext is associated with the thread's local state automatically
	 * when it is created. A call to getInstance() will return the
	 * ServiceContext for the the current thread only. The close() method will
	 * release all ServiceResources from the thread's state. The constructor and
	 * close() methods are protected so that only the subclasses can invoke
	 * them. This allows the framework control over the lifecycle of the context
	 * and prevents other objects from access the thread state directly.
	 * <p/>
	 *
	 * This object is not thread-safe and must never be shared across threads.
